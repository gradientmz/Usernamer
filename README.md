# Usernamer

An app for picking account and project names when you don't know what to use! 1/1/2020

Usernamer makes word pairs automatically and displays them in a list as you keep scrolling. You can also favorite names to re-examine or compare later in the Saved Usernames page.

This was my first project with flutter, and I'm enjoying using it so far!
